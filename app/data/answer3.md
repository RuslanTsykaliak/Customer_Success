Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. We’ve noticed a significant decrease in your build activity over the past quarter, with usage dropping by about 50%. Given that your Vercel subscription plays a key role in your marketing infrastructure, we wanted to reach out to understand if there are any challenges or changes in your development process that might be contributing to this decline.

Additionally, we’ve observed some errors in your builds recently, which could be related to your use of Cloudflare as a reverse proxy.

Understanding that Tanner, the lead on your project, has left the company, we’d appreciate the opportunity to connect with you or another team member to discuss your current needs and how we can best support your goals moving forward.

Please let us know a convenient time for a brief call, or if you prefer to continue via email. We are here to assist in any way we can.
