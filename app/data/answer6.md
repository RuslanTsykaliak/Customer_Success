Hello,

Thank you for reaching out. We understand you have some questions regarding your recent bill and how we can help manage future usage costs.

1. **Why didn’t my MIUs cover this bill?**
MIUs (Managed Infrastructure Units) are monthly entitlements for usage purchased, but they do not roll over from month to month. This means that if the full MIUs allocated for the month were not used, they are not carried over to the next month. The overage you’ve experienced with fast data transfer and function duration likely stemmed from usage that exceeded the allocated entitlements.

2. **What would be the best way to help mitigate this in the future?**
   * Optimize your application’s performance by ensuring that data transfer and function duration are kept to a minimum. For example, you can reduce the amount of data transferred by caching static assets and using efficient APIs.
   * Monitor your usage regularly through the Vercel dashboard to track your MIU consumption and ensure that you are staying within your allocated entitlements.
   * We also recommend exploring Next.js features that can optimize performance and reduce data transfer, such as static site generation (SSG) and incremental static regeneration (ISR).

Please feel free to reach out if you would like assistance optimizing your usage or if you need further clarification on any of the above.
