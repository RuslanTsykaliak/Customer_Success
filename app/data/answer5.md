Hello Travis,

I hope this message finds you well. We’ve noticed a significant increase in your Vercel usage, with your upcoming billing period showing a jump from $900 to $2,100, primarily due to higher data transfer costs related to the website's Core Web Vitals performance, specifically a failed Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) score.

We’d like to understand if there have been any recent changes to the website that could be contributing to this increase in costs and performance issues. We’d be happy to help you identify potential optimizations to reduce data transfer and improve your LCP score, ensuring better performance and cost efficiency going forward.


Please let us know if you’d like to discuss further, and we’ll be happy to assist in any way we can.
