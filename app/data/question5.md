## A Pro customer who typically spends $900 monthly on Vercel has experienced a sudden increase to $2,100 for their next billing period due to increased data transfer costs. Their main website also shows poor Core Web Vitals performance, specifically a failed Largest Contentful Paint score. Be proactive in reaching out to this customer about their increased usage and costs. Engage them in a conversation that explores the situation and leads to mutually beneficial solutions.
