Hi Trevor,

A great question! 

Choosing between Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, and Edge Middleware depends on the specific needs of your application, especially when considering personalized experiences based on geolocation.

* Edge Functions are ideal when you need to run code at the edge of the network (closer to the user's location) to improve performance and reduce latency. Since you're working with geolocation for personalized offers, Edge Functions can be a good choice as they enable you to handle requests and serve customized content based on the user's location in real-time.
* Serverless Functions allow you to run code without managing servers, making them perfect for backend operations that require scalability and ease of management. Serverless is great for handling tasks like processing form submissions or integrating with APIs, and it can be used in combination with Edge Functions for better performance.
* Edge Middleware provides a layer where you can execute code before a request reaches your application. It's a great option if you want to customize the behavior of requests based on geolocation, such as determining which shipping options are available depending on the location.

For your winery's use case, if the goal is to personalize the shopping experience for users based on where they are located (like offering different shipping options or restricting products based on legal constraints), you could benefit from Edge Functions to handle the geolocation-based personalization at the edge. This ensures a faster and more responsive user experience.
