Hello Christy,


It is a great question!

Next.js builds on top of React and offers several advantages, especially for your team's goals. **For example, when it comes to SEO (Search Engine Optimization), Next.js provides built-in features like server-side rendering.** This means your web pages are pre-loaded with content that search engines can index before the user even visits them. This approach greatly improves visibility on search engines and ensures your marketing pages meet SEO best practices. Additionally, Next.js includes automatic code splitting, so your pages load faster—key for better performance and core web vitals.

If we take the house-building analogy, React is like a set of building materials, while Next.js provides pre-constructed building pieces you can use to assemble your house quickly. With React, you’d get all the individual tools—like bricks and wood—to build your app from scratch. But with Next.js, those tools are already assembled into ready-to-use parts, saving you time and effort so you can focus on the design and functionality of your house.

In short, with Next.js, you’ll spend less time setting up the foundation and more time creating the content and features that matter most to your customers.
