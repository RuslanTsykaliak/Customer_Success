## An Enterprise customer, new to Next.js and Vercel, asks about a high usage bill regarding fast origin transfer and fast data transfer. They have two questions:
### a. Why didn’t my MIUs cover this bill? I didn’t use all my MIUs last month…so why didn’t those roll over?
### b. What would be the best way to help mitigate this so we don’t see these overage bills in the future?
### Your Enterprise customer is an SMB customer, under 50 employees, with an ARR of $18,500. Their last overage bill was $1,800 and consisted primarily of fast data transfer and function duration.
### MIU == Managed Infrastructure Unit and is a monthly entitlement for usage purchased by a customer that does not roll over every month.
